### The game have the next rules:
This is essentially connect-four, but the pieces stack on either side of the board instead of bottom-up.
Two players see a board, which is a grid of 7 rows and 7 columns. They take turn adding pieces to a row, on one of the sides. The pieces stack on top of each other, and the game ends when there are no spaces left available, or when a player has four consecutive pieces on a diagonal, column, or row.
